# Criteria A: Planning
## Problem Definition
My client is - wants ...(See the evidence of Consultation in the Appendix)

## Success Criteria
1. The calculator should accept user input to perform basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
2. The calculator can handle typical errors (e.g., division by zero) and give appropriate feedback.
3. If the user enters the secret code ("open123"), the program will change modes and act as a password manager.
4. In password manager mode, the user should be able to preform CRUD operations (Create, Replace, Update, Delete):
* Add a password (for example, for a website).
* View the stored passwords (only if they re-enter the secret code).
* Optionally, display the passwords in a "masked" form (e.g., showing only the first and last characters).
5. Basic Security Features:
6. Store passwords in a text file.
7. HL: Implement a basic obfuscation technique or basic encryption (e.g., reversing the password string or shifting characters by a fixed number) 
8. Use the terminal to interact with the user.
